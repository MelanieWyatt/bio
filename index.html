            <p>My older sister Allison is the most positive influence in my life. I am choosing her because despite everything she has been through, she has still managed to be successful and kept a smile on her face. She has taught me that no matter what life throws at you to knock you down you can get right back up and be even stronger. </p>

            <p>Growing up with her we fought like cats and dogs. I might’ve accidentally broken her arm in a fight one day and told her she could hit me back. She was in a cast for a few months and when she got out of it – she hit me with it. She taught me how to defend myself. </p>

             <p>Ally has taught me how to make friends for life. She was the first friend I ever had and will be my best friend until the day I die. Originally, she made me go introduce myself to her friends so I would not be lonely. She reminds me every day how to be kind to everybody no matter what. </p>

            <p>She has been through so much in her 19 years of living that it really inspires me to not take anything I have for granted. When she was diagnosed  with a functional movement disorder when she was younger (which makes her have tremors when she’s sick or stressed), I saw she started working harder than ever to make sure she was just like the other kids and I was so inspired. She started running cross country when she was a freshman to help her get over her disorder and it made her so strong.</p>

         <div class="col-12">
         <p>After she was put in a wheelchair for not being able to walk (due to her bad tremors in her legs), the doctor said it’d take her over a year to get back being able to walk normal again. She was so determined to prove them wrong that within 6 months she was walking again. That made me so inspired. She is the definition of a girl who is a fighter.</p>

            <p>Whenever I am sick, she is the first one to try to make me feel better and make sure I will be okay and makes sure I am not fixing to die. I can truly count on her for every single thing. If I have a problem – I know I can go to her and she will have a solution. If I want to fight someone – she will be there and will be able to calm me down. She is the best big sister I truly could’ve ever asked for. I am so blessed to have her as my big sister and that I will join her in college at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.</p>
